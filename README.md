## LA1TV actually does documentation and organisation!
A collection of docs, in markdown format, to supplement the rtf copies found on Google drive.
Please link all assets e.g. through Gdrive, or store them in the assets folder, which won't be synced to Github.
Also please keep them up to date and organised where you can!
