Luna is our network storage provided by the University. This is where the majority of our bulk storage for footage is kept, properly archived.¬†

This can be connected to on any machine outside the University as well as on Campus in order to remotely access the recorded footage.¬†
Please be careful as this may be our hard copy of footage - always work with copies!!

  Steps:

1. (Only applies if not connected on campus) - You need to be connected to the university VPN.¬†

A full detailed video guide can be found here: [https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/vpn/](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/vpn/)  

In short:

- Download the VPN application, Global Protect, from Lancaster Apps anywhere ([https://apps.lancaster.ac.uk/login](https://apps.lancaster.ac.uk/login)). If you are unsure how to use this software, see the guide here: [https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/software/](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/software/).![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeHmAWvXhU9futcX5M9YDE1-NUzhn25xbRUJvoEpgB6cIZrFIkiQvevWjuJhoEGVaZNQ1RhrH63NBlsngYKn902nmMFkq_h8ri3y8BWd90MAhq7lDfujGL9rn30L5INWifbuIEIN2K6A7yJpNvck6_wgkxX?key=DyK4WpEiE4CLApwWWczFNQ)
    
- Launch the program from the start menu, and afterwards it can be removed from the Cloudpaging Player. (select the program -> remove)
- Enter the Portal address: globalprotect.lancs.ac.uk
- This should bring up a Lancaster Login popup, fill in Uni credentials and one time passcode from your device.¬†
- You‚Äôre now connected to the VPN - this can be accessed from the system tray icon in the bottom right of a Windows taskbar at anytime, and can be disconnected or reconnected through this GUI (pictured).
